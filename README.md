Wiki is a lite version of an encyclopedia that can help to store information in MarkDown format.

# Using Wiki

When you visit the site for the first time, on the home page you would see the list of all list of entries on the encyclopedia.

Clicking on any of the entries will take you to the individual page for that particular entry.

On each entry page, at the end of each entry is an edit button where you can edit the entry if you spot a mistake or want to update certain information.

On the side bar on the left, you could go back Home.

You could also click on "Create a new page" upon which a form will appear where you can create a new entry for the encyclopedia.

You could also go to random pages by clicking on the "Random Page" link on the side bar.

Finally, on the side bar is a search bar that can help to search for certain enteries. If you input the direct title of an entry, you go to that page directly. If not, you are shown a list of entries that have titles that are similar to the search parameter.
